# AeroExplore-Browser
AeroExplore the Open Source, non resource intensive bare-bones web browser for Linux, macOS, Windows. For gamers or for people who donâ€™t like Google Chrome using 90% of CPU

AeroExplore is Public Domain, and open source which means anybody can contribute change or do anything they want with it. perhaps I even encourage you to contribute and customize/change assets to your desire.
